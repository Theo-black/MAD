UCC MOBILE APP.
This mobile app is designed to provide essential information about the University of the Commonwealth Caribbean and its IT Department. 
Our user interface, which adheres to the principles of material design, provides simple navigation across sections devoted to courses, admissions, social media, faculty/staff directory,
and email floating action button (FAB). Users can access faculty members' photographs, phone numbers, and emails in the Faculty/Staff Directory and even send them emails or
make calls right from the app. The Courses section uses FirebaseÂ for effective data storage and offers comprehensive information on ten courses. The Admissions section also lists
the admission requirements and provides a link to UCC's Application Page. Users may utilize our integrated social media tool to stay in touch, and take advantage of the Email FAB to send an email to the HOD.
